# varint.wasm

varint implemented in web assembly.
This isn't actually faster than the javascript [varint](https://github.com/chrisdickinson/varint),
because of the overhead of calling into webassembly.
However, if you incoporated this into another implementation
that was more web assembly then it would be really quite fast.

So, not intended for use yet, but published incase it's useful for
anyone.
